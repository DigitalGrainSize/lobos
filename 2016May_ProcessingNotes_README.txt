When processing, take note of the following:


GPS was tracking slowly until the morning of 5/11/2016. We may want to assign images taken before then coordinates from the last image of that site.

Macro images starting with st548 have a darker center (camera shifted in canister?). New calibration images were taken.

Images from sites st775-st799 are narrower from top to bottom than usual because Tusso is an idiot and thinks he understands computer programming.
